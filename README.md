# Obsidian Linker Plugin

## How to Use

All you have to do is run the "Link Vault" command. Any file changes will be prompted, and no note changes are automatic.

The first link may be slow, but subsequent links should be much faster as results are cached & reused if possible.

## Developement

Please see the [developer documentation](DEV.md)
